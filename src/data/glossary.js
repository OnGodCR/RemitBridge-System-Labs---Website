    term: 'Compliance checks',

    term: 'De-risking',
    plain:
      'A large bank ending its correspondent relationships with smaller banks in markets it judges risky or not worth the compliance cost, rather than screening each one. Payments to those markets then need more hops, and each hop can add a fee.',

    id: 'currency-liquidity',
    term: 'Currency liquidity',
    plain:

    id: 'capital-controls',
    term: 'Capital controls',
    plain:
      'Government limits on how freely money can enter or leave a country: caps, approvals, or restrictions on holding foreign currency. Every transfer across that border carries the friction they add.',

  {
    id: 'last-mile',
    term: 'Last mile',
    plain:
      'The final step of getting money into the recipient\'s hands, after it has arrived in the country: the trip to a pickup agent, the agent\'s own cut, the cash that has to be physically there. Where the recipient lives far from town, this step alone can be a large share of the cost.',

    id: 'coping-strategy',
    term: 'Coping strategy',
    plain:
      'What a household does to get through a shock: sell something, eat less, borrow, send a member to work elsewhere. Some cost more later than they raise now; selling the animals that earn next year\'s income is the expensive kind.',

    term: 'Capital flows',
